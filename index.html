            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                DocDynamo is an AI based RAG application which lets users query their own
                PDF/Docx/ZIP/RAR files and get meaningful insights with high context-relevancy and
                reduced hallucinations than other LLMs. Docdynamo lets you generate your mindmap from
                pdfs along with important question generation, concept generation and youtube
                recommendation personalised to your query.

            <h3>Types Of Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                Although, we don't collect any data from our users but for the user's knowledge we take their
                data as input to our RAG system for processing so that the model can actually give you
                accurate answers which is actually beneficial for you all.

            <h3>Use of Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Better contextual answer retrieval.</li>
                <li>Faster response and reduced hallucinations.</li>

            <h3>Data Storage & Retention</h3>
            <p>
                DocDynamo does not store your documents permanently. All user data provided (PDFs,
                DOCX, ZIP/RAR files) is temporarily used only during your session for generating
                answers. Once the session ends or the app is closed, the files are deleted from our servers
                automatically. We prioritize short-term, session-based processing to ensure user data
                privacy.

        <div class="policy-content-header">
            <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>
                We do not share, sell, or trade your personal data or documents with any third parties. All
                file processing is done internally using our RAG pipeline and large language model
                infrastructure. No external APIs or third-party systems are used to process your files unless
                explicitly mentioned.

            <h3>Security Measures</h3>
            <p>
                We implement best practices for secure file handling :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>All documents are transmitted over encrypted HTTPS channels.</li>
                <li>Temporary file storage is protected with access controls.</li>
                <li>Internal logs do not include any user-uploaded content.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="policy-content-header">
            <h3>User Control</h3>
            <p>
                You are in full control of what you upload to DocDynamo. You can choose what documents
                to process and delete them from the interface anytime during the session. If you uninstall the
                app, no trace of your previous data remains on our servers.
